The scene parameters (all in units with respect to world coordinate system) found through rendering the scene are as follows:

1. Sphere1: size: radius = 3, location: (-2,7,2)
2. Sphere2: size: radius = 2.2, location: (1.5,5,0)
3. Floor: size: (40 , 400), location: (7, -2, 0), rotation in degree : (0, 81.8, 0 )
4. Light Source: Location: (-4, 8, 10)
5. Camera: Location: (-1, 5, 15), FOV: 45 degrees, near plane = 0.1, far plane = 100

Note: Location and rotation are in (x, y, z) format.
